# Sales Insights Analysis – Internship Project (Kailash G Exports)

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how sales data can be collected, cleaned, analyzed, and converted into actionable business insights for a sales team. The work is inspired by my Data Analyst internship at Kailash G Exports (May 2025 – July 2025), where I analyzed company-provided sales data and shared insights to help improve sales performance and overall profitability.

## 🎯 Objective

- SQL
- MS Excel (for basic checks and summaries)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Tasks Performed
- Collected and worked with sales data provided by the company  
- Cleaned and preprocessed raw data to handle missing values and inconsistencies  
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends  
- Generated actionable insights for the sales team  

## 🔍 Sample Insights (Demonstration)
